# The Artificial Business
*Empower your organization with secure Artificial Assistant*

---
 
"The Artificial Business", a Luxembourgish company, addresses the pressing challenge of uncontrolled AI adoption and the associated risks to data security. Many employees currently use AI tools without their employer’s consent, which often results in the outsourcing of company data and methodologies to external SaaS providers. By internalizing AI models, organizations can transform these tools into internal assets, thereby enhancing data protection and control. The Artificial Business (“TAB”) provides a solution through custom, on-premises artificial assistants tailored to meet the unique needs of each organization. 

TAB’s product is designed to protect sensitive data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (such as GDPR) and operational reliability. By keeping AI tools on-premises, companies can maintain complete control over their data and processes, mitigating the risks posed by typical external SaaS offerings and ensuring that their proprietary methodologies and information remain secure. 

TAB’s AI solution is not only secure but also efficient and flexible. The Artificial Business enables companies to deploy specialized AI models that can be easily updated as organizational needs evolve. This ensures that enterprises remain at the forefront of technological innovation without sacrificing security. 

The AI assistants can integrate with existing infrastructure, providing increased productivity and creativity. With features such as role-based access controls, data segmentation, and a user-friendly interface, The Artificial Business empowers enterprises of all size and all industries to leverage AI responsibly, driving sustainable growth and improving overall productivity. This approach allows companies to reap the benefits of AI while maintaining the highest standards of data protection and avoiding the traps that the AI’s hype can set.
